# Co-op Enemy Mirroring — Play Test Guide (M2 + Gohma)

## What's new since your last test

- **Enemies mirror**: one game (the "authority") runs enemy AI; the other shows the exact same enemies — same position, movement, animation. When a mob activates because one player got close, the other player sees the same thing.
- **Hits work from both sides**: the mirrored player's hits are validated by the authority through the enemy's own damage code (vulnerability windows, i-frames all respected). Deaths and item drops still happen naturally on both screens.
- **Dynamic spawns sync**: Stalchildren at night, Gohma larvae, Octorok rocks — spawn on both screens.
- **Gohma is a co-op boss fight** (first boss slice; the other bosses now use the same adapter pattern).
- **Controller isolation**: each instance is pinned to its own Xbox pad (test-a = first pad, test-b = second pad), and pads keep working when the window isn't focused. Keyboard always drives the focused window.

## How to launch

1. Plug in both Xbox controllers **before** launching (pad order = connection order; if the pads feel swapped, swap the physical controllers or edit `Controllers.Port0GamepadOrdinal` in each instance's `shipofharkinian.json`).
2. Run `launch-coop-test.bat`. Both instances auto-load their save (File 1 / File 2) — no menu input needed.
3. Optional fast travel for testing: set `"TestAutoWarpEntrance"` in `CVars.gRemote.Anchor` (in each `shipofharkinian.json`) to `0` (Deku Tree lobby) or `1039` (Gohma's arena, 0x40F). `-1` = off. Both saves already have the "began Gohma battle" flag set, so the boss intro is the short version.

## Test script

1. **Deku Baba mirror** (Deku Tree lobby): Player A walks up to a Baba while B watches from a distance. Expected: it emerges and lunges identically on both screens, tracking A. Then B kills one: hit lands, death animation + drop appear on **both** screens.
2. **Second enemy type**: repeat on a Skulltula — proves the generic path.
3. **Contact damage**: B stands in an enemy's attack — B takes damage on B's screen.
4. **Gohma intro**: enter the boss room together. Each screen plays its own (short) intro; afterwards one Gohma, same spot, same movement on both screens.
5. **Vulnerability windows**: A stuns Gohma (slingshot to the red eye), B sword-hits the stunned eye — damage counts once, eye/flash visuals match. B attacking the closed eye does nothing on either screen (the authority's Gohma rejects it).
6. **Larvae wave**: Gohma climbs and lays eggs — eggs fall and hatch on both screens. B kills one: dies on both, no crash (this exercises the parent-pointer fix).
7. **Defeat**: final blow from either player. Defeat cutscene plays on both screens; heart container appears for both (one grab shares it); blue warp appears (the authority picks its spot, so it lands in the same place on both screens); room stays cleared after re-entry.
8. **Input isolation**: both pads at once with only one window focused — each pad must only drive its own window.

## Known limitations (updated for #4111)

The first-round limitations (authority-only aggro, authority-only enemy sounds, unmirrored Floormasters, Gohma's warp spot) are fixed: nearest-player targeting is in the M3 guide, enemy SFX and particles are mirrored, Floormasters have an adapter, and the authority picks the boss warp spot. What is still open:

- **Bongo Bongo** has no adapter yet (#4052). Every other boss and miniboss is mirrored through `ActorSyncAdapter`; see `docs/design/coop-boss-checklist.md` for the per-boss status.
- Authority loss, stale streams and host handoff have not been live-tested across the bosses.
- If one game hard-crashes, the other's enemies freeze ~1.5 s, then resume under local AI.
- Malformed or out-of-range network packets are dropped (and logged as `dropped ...`) instead of crashing the tab. If you see those lines in a normal two-player session, report them.

## If something looks wrong

Logs: `test-a\logs\Ship of Harkinian.log` / `test-b`. Grep for `Fuzzy`, `No match`, `limb mismatch`, `ghost-kill` — those are the desync canaries. Kill switch: set `"EnemySyncMirroring": 0` under `CVars.gRemote.Anchor` to fall back to pure M1 (shared HP only).
