/**
 * EnemySync
 *
 * M1 (shared HP + synced deaths): tracks every ACTORCAT_ENEMY / ACTORCAT_BOSS
 * actor under a composite identity that is deterministic across clients. Local
 * hits are broadcast; remote hits are re-applied through the enemy's own
 * collision-damage path (synthetic AC_HIT) so reactions and drops play out
 * naturally on every client.
 *
 * M2 (host-authority mirroring): the same-scene client with the lowest clientId
 * runs enemy AI and streams pos/rot/focus/health/jointTable every game frame
 * (ENEMY_STATE). Other clients suppress tracked enemies' updates via the
 * ShouldActorUpdate hook, apply the streamed state in the actor's own update
 * slot, and re-submit its colliders so weapon hits, contact damage, and
 * Z-targeting keep working. Mirror-side hits travel to the authority as
 * ENEMY_HIT_REQUEST. Deaths hand control back to the local simulation
 * (M1 path) so death animations and item drops stay local and natural.
 * Enemies with no fresh stream (authority elsewhere / disconnected) fall back
 * to local AI — plain M1 behavior, per actor.
